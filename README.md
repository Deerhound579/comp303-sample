This is my solution to [COMP303 Sample Midterm Winter2016](https://github.com/prmr/COMP303/blob/master/Sample-Midterm.pdf). If you find any mistake, feel free to report it in an issue.

All codes in `cards` package are modified based on [Solitaire](https://github.com/prmr/Solitaire), a demonstration application for the software development course at McGill University (COMP 303)
authored by Professor Martin Robillard([@prmr](https://github.com/prmr)).

## Structure

```
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── drawing 
├── src 
│   ├── cad
│   ├── cards
│   └── vending_machine
└── test
    └── UtilTest.java

```

`drawing`: diagrams

`src`: each package corresponds to a question

I skipped functionalities for `Machine` in `vending_machine`. 

`test`: Now it only tests `countAces`

Good luck!
